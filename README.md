In this game, I have used active MVC. All models are holding the data having only logic regarding their data. Game actions and updating models are done by the controller. And finally, views are just a representation of the data on the screen, they can be just a simple logger on the console or showing a cool animation.

Zenject dependency injection framework is being used for binding classes. Plus, xNode is used as the behavior tree tool to implement the controller.
